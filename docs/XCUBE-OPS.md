# Xcube Operation Definions


## Dataset Operations

- Init Xcube
- List Xcubes
- Load Xcube(s) (e.g. from remote (object) storage)
- Save Xcube(s) (save changed variables instead of whole Cube, zarr might handle that via it's persistancy already)
- Move Xcube(s) (e.g. to remote (object) storage)
- Delete Xcube(s)
- Cast Xcube
- Cast Xcube Variables

# Manipulate Xcubes

- Merge Xcubes
- Copy/Clone Xcube
- Add Variable(s)
- Remove Variable(s)
- Purge Variables (delete all variables)
- Resize Xcube (e.g. extend time frame)
- Manage Attributes of XCube
- Manage Attributes of Variables
- Apply Arithmetic Operations
- Transpose?

# Query Operations

- List Xcubes
- Query Xcube Variables
- Query Xcube Attributes
- Query Xcube Variable Attributes
